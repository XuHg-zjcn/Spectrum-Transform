# Visible image to Thermal infrared
some years ago I broght a FLIR E4 Camera, a Visible camera 640x480 inside, I hacked thermal resolution from 80x60 to 320x240
I hope eveyone can to enjoy the Thermal image, but is expensive, over 6000 RMB, seldom person can buy it
I try transfrom normal phone camera image to thermal image
but can't get temperature from transformed image, I will using some sensor
## sensor outside
* Temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11,...)
* low resolution thermal image sensor (low cost)
  * MLX90614 16x4 ~100RMB
  * AMG8833 8x8 ~200RMB
  * MLX90640 32x24 ~400RMB
